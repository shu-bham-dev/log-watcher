This project implements a log-watching solution where the server monitors a remote log file and streams updates to a web-based client in real-time. The server is built with Node.js and Express, while the client is a React application.

## Features

- Real-time log updates using WebSocket communication.
- Server pushes updates to multiple clients simultaneously.
- Efficient handling of log file changes without retransmitting the entire file.
- Web-based client accessible via a URL (e.g., http://localhost/log).
